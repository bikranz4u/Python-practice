# A string is created by entering text between two single or double quotation marks. 
print (" This is a string")

#Some characters can't be directly included in a string. 
#For instance, double quotes can't be directly included in a double quote string; 
#this would cause it to end prematurely.

print ('He's a good boy')  # SyntaxError: invalid syntax
