#In-place operators allow you to write code like 'x = x + 3' more concisely, as 'x += 3'. 
#The same thing is possible with other operators such as -, *, / and % as well.
x = 2
print (x)

x+=3 # This statement is same as x = x + 3

print (x)

# Operators can be used on types other than numbers, as well, such as strings.
x = "spam"
print(x)
x *= 3  #String addition 
x += "eggs"
print(x)
print(x)
