# Why while loop came up ( Weakness in If Statement)
#An if statement is run once if its condition evaluates to True, and never if it evaluates to False. 

# A while statement is similar, except that it can be run more than once. 
# The statements inside it are repeatedly executed, as long as the condition holds. 
# Once it evaluates to False, the next section of code is executed. 

i = 1
while i <=5:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1

print("Finished!")

#The code in the body of a while loop is executed repeatedly. This is called iteration.
